This package exists to replace the heavy, complex, and difficult to use (in my opinion) [go-sdk](https://github.com/cloudevents/sdk-go).

## Example

See [main.go](./main.go)

## Features

- High level getters and setters for fasthttp request/response: [`GetEvents`](https://godoc.org/github.com/CreativeCactus/fast-cloudevents-go/fastce#GetEvents), [`SetEvents`](https://godoc.org/github.com/CreativeCactus/fast-cloudevents-go/fastce#SetEvents)
- [Flexible CloudEvents type](https://godoc.org/github.com/CreativeCactus/fast-cloudevents-go/jsonce#CloudEvent)
- Lightweight, easy to audit

## V1 spec

See [JSON](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/json-format.md), [HTTP](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/http-protocol-binding.md) specifications.
