# Fast Cloudevents

A small, versatile implementation of a superset (relaxed) [cloudevents spec](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec).

This package exists to replace the heavy, complex, and difficult to use [go-sdk](https://github.com/cloudevents/sdk-go).

It is currently a reference implementation of a consumer (server) with fasthttp, but will become a portable set of middlewares.
